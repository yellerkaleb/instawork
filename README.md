Instawork interview assignment using React and Django.

The application was built in approximately 85 minutes broken down as follows:
- 50 minutes setting up box: installing react, django and dependencies
- 10 minutes on code
- 25 minutes debugging, mostly installation/interconnectivity issues 


I used chatGPT with the following prompt:
    "I am a software engineer with solid programming skills with no experience in React and Django. You will help me create the following app: [the instawork assignament was copy/pasted here]".


I am stack-asnostic, and as with all stacks, I usually spend more time on the initial setup (1-3 hours), than the actual code. 

Code is code is code.
