Instawork interview assignment using React and Django.

The application was built in approximately 85 minutes broken down as follows:
- 50 minutes setting up box: installing react, django and dependencies
- 10 minutes on code
- 25 minutes debugging, mostly installation/interconnectivity issues 

I am stack-agnostic. As with all stacks, I usually spend more time on the initial setup (1-3 hours), than the actual code.
